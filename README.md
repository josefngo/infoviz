## README
This project can only be run through a server due to web browser security restrictions with crossorigin. Alternatively it can be run through an editor HTTP-server extension, such as VSCode Live Server.

### How to run with node http-server
1. `npm install -g http-server`
2. `http-server -p 8080`
3. visit `localhost:8080` in the browser

### Unused Code
Some parts of the code are unused. This is because we experimented with different ideas but due to time constraints were not able to implement all ideas.
